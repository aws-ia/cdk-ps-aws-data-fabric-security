image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/quickstart-aws-data-fabric-security-architecture-diagram.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* An architecture that spans two Availability Zones.
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets, managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* Two Classic Load Balancers, one each for the Immuta and RadiantOne services in the private subnets.
* In the private subnets, three-node EKS clusters containing highly-available deployments of Immuta and RadiantOne.
* Amazon EKS to provide the Kubernetes control plane for the clusters.
* Endpoints for other AWS services to access the Amazon EKS Kubernetes API server.
* Amazon CloudWatch to collect, store, access, and monitor logs.
* Amazon Route 53 for a private hosted zone and resolvers.
* AWS Lambda for functions that install Immuta and RadiantOne.
* AWS Secrets Manager to encrypt, store, and retrieve passwords.

[.small]#* You can choose to use an existing VPC during deployment. The existing VPC must include two private subnets in separate Availability Zones.#
