image::../docs/deployment_guide/images/data-fabric-pod-breakdown.png[Architecture]

As shown in <<architecture1>>, this Partner Solution sets up the following:

* A highly available architecture that spans two Availability Zones.*
* A virtual private cloud (VPC) configured with public and private subnets, according to AWS
best practices, to provide you with your own virtual network on AWS.*
* In the public subnets:
** Managed network address translation (NAT) gateways to allow outbound
internet access for resources in the private subnets.*
* In the private subnets:
** A 3 node Amazon Elastic Kubernetes (EKS) cluster, containing highly-available deployments of Immuta and Radiant Logic.  
** AWS VPC Endpoints for required AWS services, keeping network traffic between the EKS cluster and AWS services within the VPC. 
// Add bullet points for any additional components that are included in the deployment. Ensure that the additional components are shown in the architecture diagram. End each bullet with a period.
* An AWS classic load balancer for the Immuta service running on the EKS cluster
* An AWS classic load balancer for the Radiant Logic service running on the EKS cluster
* AWS Lambda Functions for intalling Radiant Logic and Immuta
* AWS CloudWatch Log Groups
* Secrets in AWS Secrets Manager
* Amazon Route53 private hosted zone and resolvers  

[.small]#* If desired, during the deployment an existing VPC and subnets may be used. The existing VPC must include 2 private subnets in seperate Availability Zones.#
