=== Logging in

To connect to Radiant Logic you must either connect from inside the environment (Bastion Host) or configure your local DNS to point the Radiant Logic hostname to the Load Balancer for Radiant Logic.

. Using a browser, navigate to one of the following:
+
[,bash]
----
http://radiantlogic.example.com:7070 
https://radiantlogic.example.com:7171 
----

=== Identity Sources

Radiant Logic supports multiple data sources from LDAP (eg. Active Directory), DB (eg. MySQL), and Custom data store types (eg. REST API). 
*All Data Sources are optional, but in order to setup a Global Identity you need a minimum of one Identity Store.* 

==== Adding an LDAP Store - Active Directory

This is a basic Active Directory LDAP data source configuration, for more information and options please refer to the Radiant Logic documentation.

. Create a service account in your Active Directory, this is just a normal user account and no extra permissions are necessary.
. Click on *Settings* -> *Server Backend* -> *LDAP Data Source* -> *Add*
. Fill out the *Add LDAP Data Source* form:
 .. *Data Source Name*: A Friendly name for the directory
 .. *Host Name*: Fully Qualified Domain Name for your AD (if you use a DC name or IP address the DC will be a single point of failure)
 .. *Bind DN*: The distinguishedName of the service account created in step 1
 .. *Base DN*: the distinguishedName of the OU your identities are located in (can be a top level OU with nested OUs)
 .. *Data Source Type*: AD2008
 .. *Port*: 389 for plain text or 636 for SSL (if using SSL, also check the box for SSL)
 .. *Bind Password*: the password for the service account created in step 1
. Click on *test Connection* to verify your configuration/network connectivity
. Click on *Save*

example config:

.. *Bind DN*: The distinguishedName of the service account created in step 1
.. *Base DN*: the distinguishedName of the OU your identities are located in (can be a top level OU with nested OUs)
.. *Data Source Type*: Select the Directory type or LDAP if your particular directory is not listed
.. *Port*: 389 for plain text or 636 for SSL
.. *Bind Password*: the password for the service account created in step 1
. Click on *test Connection* to verify your configuration/network connectivity
. Click on *Save*

==== Adding a Database Store

=== Global Identity

Global Identity is a feature within Radiant Logic that allows you to correlate users from various identity sources and generates a Global Profile that defines the final view of the correlated identity sources.

Steps to create a global identity:

. Create a global identity project
. Add an identity source to the project
. Upload and sync the data sources in the project

==== Create a Global Identity Project

. Click on *Wizards* -> *Global Identity Builder* -> *New Project*
. Complete the *Project* form
. On the right side, add the Custom Attributes you are interested in including as part of the Global Profile
. Input your Attribute value in the text field and select *Add Custom Attribute* for each custom attribute you wish to include
. Click on *Save*

example config:


image::../docs/operational_guide/images/global-identity-setup.PNG[GlobalIdentitySetup]

==== Add an Identity Source to Project - AD example

. Click on *Define a new Identity Source*
. Complete the Identity Source form:
.. *Data Source*: Select your previously configured Identity Store
.. *Identity Object*: user
.. *Base DN*: Select previously created base DN during ldap config
.. *Display/Search Attribute*: mail
. Click on *Save*
. In *Mapping Definitions*, click on *Auto* to auto map attributes
. Click *OK* when the warning pops up
. Click on *Save* and *Save* again

example config:

image::../docs/operational_guide/images/ad-identity-source.PNG[ADIdentitySource]

==== Upload and Sync Data Sources

. Click on *Upload/Sync* in the Global Identity Project
. Click on *Upload All* (Note: You can use Bulk Upload or Single Upload)
. On successful sync, the Status should be in FINISHED state

==== View Global Identities

. In the global profile, click on *Identities Browser*

.. Complete the *Credentials* and *Options*
+
image::../docs/operational_guide/images/immuta-to-radiantlogic.png[ImmutaToRadiantLogic]
+
.. Check *Sync attributes from LDAP/Active Directory to Immuta*
... Add all attrubutes to be used by Immuta by clicking *Add Another Attribute* and entering the attribute information for each attribute. 
.. Check *Make Default IAM*
.. Complete the process to *Test Connection*, *Test User Login*, and *Test LDAP Sync*. Once all tests are successful, click on Save (left panel).

. Click on *Advanced Configuration*
. Modify the *Advanced Configuration* textfield with the following:
